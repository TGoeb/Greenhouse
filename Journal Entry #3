Journal Entry #3
May 19, 2017

I spent a few days setting up a Raspberry Pi and trying to install Raspiviv, but due to hardware
limitations, I was never able to get it fully working.  So eventually I decided to move on and
begin working with the webcam.  I looked at a few different ways people had embedded videos in
Android apps, and many recommended using a YouTube API.  However, there were many steps I would have
had to go through, such as registering my app and signing up as a Google developer, and with limited
time left I decided to just add a link to a YouTube video.
My solution was to have the webcam stream a private video to YouTube, so if the owner of the video
was logged into the Android device, they could still view it.  Clicking on the "Webcam" button
currently brings the user to a live feed from the International Space Station, which could be
changed to the greenhouse webcam once it is set up.
Finally, I attempted to retrieve data from a website using JSON, which appears to be working,
however I did not have time to put any real data online and it only returns null.  In the end, my
app ended up more like a proof of concept, with things looking like they would have if everything
worked as intended.  However, it would need more work before it was truly finished.
