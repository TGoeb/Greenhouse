# Greenhouse
This is my Computer Science A project. It is an app that will monitor data in greenhouses.  It was
intended to use the Raspiviv API to get temperature and humidity data from a Raspberry Pi, but I
could not get that far due to hardware limitations.  There was also going to be a webcam streaming
video from the greenhouse, but instead I have a placeholder video as well as data.  I included a
JSON method which retrieves data from a website, but there was no real data for me to use.  In the
end, it ended up being more of a proof of concept.
