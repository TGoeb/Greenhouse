Journal Entry #1
May 5, 2017

The first thing I did while starting this project was creating a scrolling activity, which made a
NestedScrollView by default.  NestedScrollViews can only contain one element, so I had to put a
LinearLayout inside it, then put any other elements I needed inside the Linear Layout.
Next I added a TextView, in which I placed text for the inside and outside humidity.  I tried to add
an additional text view for the humidity, as well as an image, but neither one showed up when
running the app.
