Journal Entry #2
May 12, 2017

I learned that the NestedScrollView should actually be a ScrollView, and changing that allowed me to
see multiple elements inside the LinearLayout.  I added an image of a graph of temperature vs time,
and once I get the Raspiviv API working it will make a graph from real data for me.  Beneath the
image I added another TextView which displays inside and outside humidity.
I added a method which changes the TextViews, so that when I get data from Raspiviv, I can easily
pass it in and change the text.  After setting up and testing that method, I began setting up a
Raspberry Pi.
